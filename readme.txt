Import and archive your tweets with WordPress

== Description ==

Make a fresh WordPress install and archive all your tweets:

* WordPress is not limited to the most recent 3200 tweets
* It will automatically expand all those ugly `t.co` links
* All your #hashtags can be converted to WordPress tags
